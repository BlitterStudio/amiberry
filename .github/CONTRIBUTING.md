## Did you find a bug?

Bug reporting is an important part of making Amiberry better. If you believe you have found a bug, then please follow these steps:

* **Ensure the bug has not already been reported.** Check the existing Github [Issues](https://github.com/midwan/amiberry/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue that addresses the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/midwan/amiberry/issues/new). 
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible and **steps to recreate** the problem.

* Please use the relevant **bug report template** to create the issue. It was designed to help you fill in what we need, in order to locate
the source of the problem and find a solution in the best way possible.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new Github Pull Request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Please use the relevant **pull request template** when submitting a PR.

* Please ensure that all your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

## Do you have a request for a new feature?

* New feature ideas are welcome, but please keep in mind they will usually take lower priority over fixing bugs. An exception to that rule 
might be that it's something quite easy to implement.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Suggest your change in one of the Amiberry pages above and start writing your code.

* Please do not open an issue on Github until you have collected positive feedback about the change. Someone else might already be working
on something similar, or perhaps this change could create a problem you haven't predicted.

## Did you write something that adds new features/functionality to Amiberry?

* Open a new Github Pull Request with your changes.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes what your changes are designed to improve. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Please use the relevant **pull request template** when submitting a PR.
