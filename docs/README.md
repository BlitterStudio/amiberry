Amiberry is an optimized Amiga emulator for Intel/AMD, ARM (32bit and 64bit) and RISC-V platforms. It runs on both Linux and macOS. Windows users should use [WinUAE](https://www.winuae.net), even if Amiberry can run on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

The core emulation comes from [WinUAE](https://www.winuae.net), and even the main GUI is designed to look similar to that.
It includes JIT support to get high-performance results on CPU-intensive emulated environments, like desktop applications. On top of that, there are some unique features developed specifically for Amiberry, such as the WHDLoad booter, support for RetroArch controller mapping, and several more.

There are currently two Amiberry editions available: **Amiberry and Amiberry-Lite** - [see here](https://github.com/BlitterStudio/amiberry/wiki/First-Installation) to see which is the best pick for your needs.

## Getting Amiberry

### Linux

Amiberry is available as DEB and RPM packages for ARM32, ARM64 (aarch64) and x86_64 Linux platform distributions. You can download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/BlitterStudio/amiberry/releases) area.

A Flatpak version of Amiberry is also available on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/com.blitterstudio.amiberry), for Linux systems where that is preferred, for example the SteamDeck.

For DEB packages:

      sudo apt update && sudo apt install ./amiberry_7.0.0_arm64.deb

Or the RPM package:

      sudo dnf install ./amiberry-7.0.0-1.x86_64.rpm

Or just use the graphical front-end your distro provides (double-clicking on the DEB/RPM package should do that)

If you're on Arch Linux, you'll find Amiberry on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/amiberry) or if you use an AUR helper like [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay), you can build and run:

      yay -S amiberry

### macOS

Amiberry is available as a DMG and Homebrew package for macOS. 

For DMG package:

You can download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/BlitterStudio/amiberry/releases) area.

Or the Homebrew package:

      brew install --cask amiberry

### Distro package management

Some distros (like RetroPie, DietPi, Pimiga, and others) already include Amiberry either pre-installed or through their package management systems. Please follow the methods provided in those distros for a smoother experience and refer to their owners for support during this process.

## Compile from source

Alternatively, you can [compile the latest version of Amiberry from source](https://github.com/BlitterStudio/amiberry/wiki/Compile-from-source).
