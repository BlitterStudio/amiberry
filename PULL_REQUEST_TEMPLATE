Fixes # https://github.com/midwan/amiberry/issues/682

Changes proposed in this pull request:

Adds serial port emulation.

This is based heavily on the implementation in WinUAE for the top level
emulation (almost a direct copy of serial_win32.cpp) and parser.cpp from FS-UAE
for the low level support. The code on this branch adds some extra serial port
configuration (which also fixes issues on the FS-UAE branch).

Some notes....

-Everything is wrapped with the SERIAL_PORT switch. Existing implementations in
bot WinUAE and FA-UAE use this switch sporadically and it does not make sense to
me. It should either be used for everything or not used at all.
-Additional GUI configuration has also been added. I have no idea on the plans
here and is not necessary for the serial port emulation to be enabled if the
decision is made not to use it. It's adequate just to add the required options
to the individual configuration files.
-Only serial port emulation on a HW UART has been enabled which includes USB
based UARTS as well.
-I chose not to add enumeration for serial devices. Code is available but has
some restrictions.
-I still don't like the way this is implemented in WinUAE or FS-UAE but it is
here in that form for legacy/compatibility purposes hence the naming not having
being changed for the filename serial_win32.cpp.
