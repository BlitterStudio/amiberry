Fixes # https://github.com/midwan/amiberry/issues/682

Changes proposed in this pull request:

Adds serial port emulation.

This is based heavily on the implementation in WinUAE for the top level
emulation (almost a direct copy of serial_win32.cpp) and parser.cpp from FS-UAE
for the low level support. The code on this branch adds some extra serial port
configuration (which also fixes issues on the FS-UAE branch). I didn't enable
the Ethernet serial port mapping emulation. If there is demand for it I can
look into and/or it should be pretty trivial now that all of the base code is
there. As far as I can tell all that needs to be done is to link against
libenet.so and set SERIAL_ENET in sysconfig.h.

Some notes....

-Everything is wrapped with the SERIAL_PORT switch. Existing implementations in
both WinUAE and FS-UAE use this switch sporadically and it does not make sense
to me. It should either be used for everything or not used at all.
-Additional GUI configuration has also been added. I have no idea on the plans/
requirements here and it is not necessary for the serial port emulation to be
enabled if the decision is made not to use the GUI additions. It's adequate just
to add the required options to the individual configuration files.
-I chose not to add enumeration for serial devices for the GUI. Code is
available but has some restrictions.
-I still don't like the way this is implemented in WinUAE or FS-UAE but it is
here in that form for legacy/compatibility purposes hence the naming not having
being changed for the filename serial_win32.cpp. I'd prefer to rename this to
something more functional like serial.cpp.
-There is some extra handling for 'breakcond' which is a feature added from
WinUAE. It's not tested extensively here and a better way to handle this would
be to use SIGINT generated by the serial driver...but it's extra complexity and
I'm not sure it's necessary yet.

p.s. There's a very small link time bug as below when you build for DEBUG=1
but I didn't change that on this branch according to the guidelines. The
function needmman() isn't used anywhere so I just commented it out and it built
fine.

/usr/bin/ld: src/memory.o: in function `needmman()':
memory.cpp:72: undefined reference to `jit_direct_compatible_memory'
