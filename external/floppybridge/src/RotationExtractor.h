// Class to manage finding *exact* disk revolutions                                   //
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// Purpose:
// The class attempts to guess where an exact disk revolution occurs, and then re-aligns
// it such that it starts at the index pulse.  This means we don't need to wait for an index
// pulse to work out a revolution of the disk.  The first time a disk is used we calculate
// the time of a single revolution and then use that as a guide to how long a revolution will
// take in the future.
//
// This isn't 100% perfect but does seem to work.

// With this defined you get speed data per bit.  Undefined, per 8 bits.  Nothing seems to notice much
// Inside *UAE it uses one speed value for 16 bits of MFM data so that's probably why.
// and besides, with this *undefined* we save about 700k of ram
//#define HIGH_RESOLUTION_MODE

// Instead of outputting "speed" or "density" values this will output bit-times in ns
//#define OUTPUT_TIME_IN_NS

// So worse case is the disk takes 210ms to spin, and every sequence is VERY fast, and every sequence is 01, this number is highly unlikely though
// The x2 is for HD disks
#define MAX_REVOLUTION_SEQUENCES		(120000 * 2)

// Number of sequences to match to find the index overlap position or the rotation overlap position
// The higher the number, the more chance of perfect revolution alignment, but higher processing required at the end of each revolution
#define OVERLAP_SEQUENCE_MATCHES				1024

// When looking for overlap for indexes it doesn't need anywhere near as much data checking
#define OVERLAP_SEQUENCE_MATCHES_INDEXMODE		1024

// How many incorrect alignment values are allowed before switching to index mode
#define MAX_BAD_VALUES_BEFORE_SWITCH            4

// Extra window either side.  this allows more of a search range
#define OVERLAP_EXTRA_BUFFER			6

// Signal for index was not found
