	 * Used for drawing graphics. It contains all vital functions for drawing.
	 * We include implemented Graphics classes for some common platforms like
	 * the Allegro library, the OpenGL library and the SDL library. To make
	 * Guichan usable under another platform, a Graphics class must be
	 * implemented.
	 *
	 * In Graphics you can set clip areas to limit drawing to certain
	 * areas of the screen. Clip areas are put on a stack, which means that you
	 * can push smaller and smaller clip areas onto the stack. All coordinates
	 * will be relative to the topmost clip area. In most cases you won't have
	 * to worry about the clip areas, unless you want to implement some really
	 * complex widget. Pushing and poping of clip areas are handled
	 * automatically by container widgets when their child widgets are drawn.
	 *
	 * IMPORTANT: Remember to pop each clip area that you pushed on the stack
	 * after you are done with it.
	 *
	 * If you feel that Graphics is to restrictive for your needs, there is
	 * no one stopping you from using your own code for drawing in Widgets.
	 * You could for instance use pure SDL in the drawing of Widgets bypassing
	 * Graphics. This might however hurt portability of your application.
	 *
	 * If you implement a Graphics class not present in Guichan we would be very
	 * happy to add it to Guichan.
